# Active Context: Cr8-xyz Development

## Current Focus

Successfully implemented comprehensive Poly Haven asset browser integration for CR8. The system now provides a fully functional asset browsing experience with both compact panel and expanded dialog views, complete with filtering, search, and asset selection capabilities.

## Recent Major Achievement

- **POLY HAVEN ASSET BROWSER**: Complete end-to-end implementation
- Built comprehensive backend API proxy with FastAPI endpoints
- Created type-safe frontend service layer with error handling
- Implemented dual-view UI system (compact panel + expanded dialog)
- Added sophisticated filtering by asset types, categories, and search
- Integrated Poly Haven branding and professional UI/UX design

## Current Performance Issue

**CRITICAL**: Dialog performance severely impacted by loading 500+ assets simultaneously

- Dialog takes significant time to open/close
- Loading all Poly Haven assets at once causes UI freezing
- Need backend pagination implementation for optimal performance

## Next Priority Task

**BACKEND PAGINATION IMPLEMENTATION**

- Add pagination parameters to FastAPI endpoints (page, limit, offset)
- Implement in-memory caching for Poly Haven API responses
- Create server-side pagination logic with metadata
- Update frontend to use paginated responses
- Target: 90% performance improvement with 10-20 assets per page

## Active Decisions

- Chose session-based tracking over handler-based to avoid response bypass issues
- Maintained separate execution paths for direct UI commands vs natural language
- Implemented automatic scene refresh triggers rather than manual refresh buttons
- Prioritized immediate UI feedback over background processing delays

## Key Considerations

- **Critical Fix**: Direct UI responses were bypassing WebSocket handler refresh logic
- Session-based message tracking prevents response routing bypass issues
- Automatic list_scene_objects calls ensure UI stays synchronized with Blender state
- Dual path architecture supports both direct commands and AI agent interactions

## Current Priorities

1. **COMPLETED**: Fix refresh_context tracking for direct UI commands
2. Validate the complete flow from frontend button click to scene context update
3. Document the session-based tracking pattern for future reference
4. Monitor system performance with automatic scene refresh triggers

## Project Insights

- WebSocket response routing can bypass handler logic - use session tracking instead
- Direct UI commands need different handling patterns than AI agent commands
- Scene context synchronization is critical for user experience
- Session-based state management provides more reliable message correlation
- Automatic refresh triggers reduce user friction compared to manual refresh buttons

## Technical Achievements

- **Solved**: refresh_context flag tracking for direct addon commands
- **Implemented**: Session.pending_refresh_commands dictionary for message correlation
- **Added**: SessionManager.\_trigger_scene_context_refresh() method
- **Fixed**: Response bypass issue where Blender → SessionManager → Browser skipped handler logic
- **Enhanced**: WebSocketHandler.\_forward_message() to track refresh_context in session
