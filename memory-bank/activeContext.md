# Active Context: Cr8-xyz Development

## Current Focus

Successfully completed critical WebSocket refresh_context tracking fix for direct UI commands. The system now properly triggers automatic scene context updates when users interact with scene objects through the SceneControls interface.

## Recent Changes

- **MAJOR FIX**: Resolved refresh_context bypass issue in WebSocket message flow
- Implemented session-based tracking for direct UI commands with refresh_context flag
- Added automatic scene context refresh trigger in SessionManager.forward_message()
- Fixed dual execution path coordination between direct commands and B.L.A.Z.E agent
- Updated WebSocket handler to use session's pending_refresh_commands tracking
- Enhanced scene object interaction flow for real-time UI updates

## Next Steps

1. Monitor and test the complete refresh_context flow in production
2. Document additional WebSocket message flow patterns and edge cases
3. Optimize scene context update performance for larger scenes
4. Enhance error handling for failed scene refresh attempts

## Active Decisions

- Chose session-based tracking over handler-based to avoid response bypass issues
- Maintained separate execution paths for direct UI commands vs natural language
- Implemented automatic scene refresh triggers rather than manual refresh buttons
- Prioritized immediate UI feedback over background processing delays

## Key Considerations

- **Critical Fix**: Direct UI responses were bypassing WebSocket handler refresh logic
- Session-based message tracking prevents response routing bypass issues
- Automatic list_scene_objects calls ensure UI stays synchronized with Blender state
- Dual path architecture supports both direct commands and AI agent interactions

## Current Priorities

1. **COMPLETED**: Fix refresh_context tracking for direct UI commands
2. Validate the complete flow from frontend button click to scene context update
3. Document the session-based tracking pattern for future reference
4. Monitor system performance with automatic scene refresh triggers

## Project Insights

- WebSocket response routing can bypass handler logic - use session tracking instead
- Direct UI commands need different handling patterns than AI agent commands
- Scene context synchronization is critical for user experience
- Session-based state management provides more reliable message correlation
- Automatic refresh triggers reduce user friction compared to manual refresh buttons

## Technical Achievements

- **Solved**: refresh_context flag tracking for direct addon commands
- **Implemented**: Session.pending_refresh_commands dictionary for message correlation
- **Added**: SessionManager.\_trigger_scene_context_refresh() method
- **Fixed**: Response bypass issue where Blender → SessionManager → Browser skipped handler logic
- **Enhanced**: WebSocketHandler.\_forward_message() to track refresh_context in session
