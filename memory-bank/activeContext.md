# Active Context: Cr8-xyz Development

## Current Focus

Memory bank documentation completion and system architecture analysis for the Cr8-xyz CGI content creation platform. The system enables AI-assisted 3D content creation through natural language interfaces and real-time viewport streaming.

## Recent Changes

- System patterns documentation updated with current architecture
- Technical context documentation aligned with implementation
- Comprehensive analysis of B.L.A.Z.E agent and addon registry systems
- WebSocket communication patterns clarified

## Next Steps

1. Update progress tracking with completed documentation
2. Document detailed WebSocket message flow patterns
3. Finalize Blender addon registry and command router analysis
4. Establish comprehensive testing strategies for AI integration

## Active Decisions

- Focusing on accurate documentation of implemented systems
- Emphasizing AI agent dynamic capabilities and addon discovery
- Prioritizing real-time communication and session management patterns
- Maintaining alignment with multi-addon architecture implementation

## Key Considerations

- B.L.A.Z.E agent dynamic toolset generation from addon manifests
- Real-time viewport streaming with WebRTC integration
- Session-based singleton pattern for AI agent consistency
- Manifest-based addon discovery and validation

## Current Priorities

1. Complete memory bank documentation with current system state
2. Document AI agent integration and dynamic capability patterns
3. Analyze addon registry system and command routing
4. Understand WebRTC streaming and viewport synchronization

## Project Insights

- Strong emphasis on AI-assisted natural language interfaces
- Modular multi-addon architecture with standardized manifests
- Real-time collaboration features with WebRTC viewport streaming
- Dynamic capability discovery and toolset generation
