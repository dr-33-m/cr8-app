- ✅ **NEW**: Professional UI/UX with Poly Haven branding integration

## What's Left to Build

- [x] ~~Fix refresh_context tracking for direct UI commands~~ **COMPLETED**
- [x] ~~Implement Poly Haven asset browser~~ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] **URGENT**: Implement backend pagination for Poly Haven assets (performance issue)
- [ ] Document detailed WebSocket message flow patterns and edge cases
- [ ] Optimize scene context update performance for larger scenes
- [ ] Enhance error handling for failed scene refresh attempts
- [ ] Complete template system integration details
- [ ] Document real-time engine coordination and session management
- [ ] Establish comprehensive testing strategies for AI integration
- [ ] Finalize WebRTC streaming and viewport synchronization documentation

## Known Issues

- [x] ~~WebSocket refresh_context bypass issue~~ **FIXED**
- [x] ~~Direct UI commands not triggering scene updates~~ **FIXED**
- [x] ~~Response routing bypassing handler logic~~ **FIXED**
- [ ] WebSocket context manager requires detailed documentation
- [ ] Asset operation validation patterns need clarification
- [ ] Template system operator and property documentation needs completion
- [ ] Real-time engine session management patterns require detailed analysis

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Adopted structured documentation system for knowledge persistence
2. **Component Separation**: Maintaining clear boundaries between frontend, Cr8 engine, and Blender integration
3. **AI Integration Focus**: Emphasizing B.L.A.Z.E agent and dynamic capability discovery
4. **Real-time Focus**: Emphasizing WebSocket-based communication and WebRTC streaming
5. **Modular Architecture**: Supporting extensible template and addon systems with standardized manifests
6. **NEW - Session-Based Tracking**: Chose session tracking over handler tracking to prevent response bypass issues
7. **NEW - Automatic Refresh**: Implemented automatic scene context refresh instead of manual refresh buttons

## Recent Technical Achievements

### WebSocket Refresh Context Fix (COMPLETED)

- **Problem**: Direct UI commands with refresh_context flag weren't triggering scene updates
- **Root Cause**: Blender responses bypassed WebSocketHandler and went directly through SessionManager
- **Solution**: Implemented session-based pending_refresh_commands tracking
- **Implementation**:
  - Added Session.pending_refresh_commands dictionary
  - Enhanced SessionManager.forward_message() to check for successful responses
  - Added SessionManager.\_trigger_scene_context_refresh() method
  - Updated WebSocketHandler.\_forward_message() to track refresh_context in session
- **Result**: Direct UI interactions now automatically trigger scene context updates

### Poly Haven Asset Browser Implementation (COMPLETED)

- **Achievement**: Complete end-to-end asset browsing system integration
- **Backend**: FastAPI proxy API with full Poly Haven endpoint coverage
  - `/api/v1/polyhaven/types` - Asset types (hdris, textures, models)
  - `/api/v1/polyhaven/assets` - Browse assets with filtering
  - `/api/v1/polyhaven/assets/{id}/info` - Detailed asset information
  - `/api/v1/polyhaven/assets/{id}/files` - Downloadable file listings
  - `/api/v1/polyhaven/authors/{id}` - Author information
  - `/api/v1/polyhaven/categories/{type}` - Category filtering with counts
  - Complete Pydantic models with type safety and error handling
- **Frontend**: Professional dual-view UI system
  - **PolyHavenPanel**: Compact sidebar with 6 assets, type filtering, expand option
  - **PolyHavenDialog**: Full-screen browser with advanced search and filtering
  - **AssetCard**: Beautiful thumbnails with hover effects, metadata, and interactions
  - **AssetGrid**: Responsive grid with loading states and error handling
  - **AssetFilters**: Comprehensive filtering by type, categories, and search
- **Features**: Complete asset browsing experience
  - Asset type tabs with color coding (HDRIs=blue, Textures=green, Models=purple)
  - Category filtering with asset counts (top 20 categories)
  - Real-time search across names, tags, categories, and authors
  - Asset selection with toast notifications and console logging
  - Direct links to Poly Haven website for detailed views
  - Professional branding with Poly Haven logo integration
- **Performance Issue Identified**: Loading 500+ assets causes dialog freezing
- **Next Priority**: Backend pagination implementation for optimal performance

## Next Documentation Priorities

1. Document the session-based tracking pattern for future WebSocket work
2. Detailed WebSocket message routing and session management documentation
3. Performance optimization patterns for scene context updates
4. Error handling strategies for WebSocket message failures
5. Template system operator and property documentation
6. AI agent context management and dynamic toolset generation

## Verification Points

- [x] System patterns match actual implementation
- [x] Technical context reflects current stack
- [x] Active context priorities are accurate
- [x] **NEW**: Refresh_context tracking system is working correctly
- [x] **NEW**: Session-based message correlation is properly documented
