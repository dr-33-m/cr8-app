# Progress Tracking: Cr8-xyz Development

## Current Status

✅ Memory bank initialization completed
✅ Core documentation framework established
✅ System analysis and documentation updated

## What Works

- ✅ Project brief and product context defined and maintained
- ✅ Active context and development priorities established and updated
- ✅ System patterns and architecture documented with current implementation
- ✅ Technical context and stack identified and aligned with reality
- ✅ Memory bank structure in place and actively maintained

## What's Left to Build

- [ ] Document detailed WebSocket message flow patterns
- [ ] Finalize Blender addon registry and command router documentation
- [ ] Complete template system integration details
- [ ] Document real-time engine coordination and session management
- [ ] Establish comprehensive testing strategies for AI integration
- [ ] Finalize WebRTC streaming and viewport synchronization documentation

## Known Issues

- [ ] WebSocket context manager requires detailed documentation
- [ ] Asset operation validation patterns need clarification
- [ ] Template system operator and property documentation needs completion
- [ ] Real-time engine session management patterns require detailed analysis

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Adopted structured documentation system for knowledge persistence
2. **Component Separation**: Maintaining clear boundaries between frontend, Cr8 engine, and Blender integration
3. **AI Integration Focus**: Emphasizing B.L.A.Z.E agent and dynamic capability discovery
4. **Real-time Focus**: Emphasizing WebSocket-based communication and WebRTC streaming
5. **Modular Architecture**: Supporting extensible template and addon systems with standardized manifests

## Next Documentation Priorities

1. Detailed WebSocket message routing and session management documentation
2. Blender addon registry and command router analysis with parameter validation
3. Template system operator and property documentation
4. Real-time engine session management and Blender instance coordination
5. AI agent context management and dynamic toolset generation

## Verification Points

- [x] Memory bank files align with .clinerules configuration
- [x] System patterns match actual implementation
- [x] Technical context reflects current stack
- [x] Active context priorities are accurate
