# Progress Tracking: Cr8-xyz Development

## Current Status

✅ Memory bank initialization completed
✅ Core documentation framework established
✅ System analysis and documentation updated
✅ **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: WebSocket refresh_context tracking fix completed

## What Works

- ✅ Project brief and product context defined and maintained
- ✅ Active context and development priorities established and updated
- ✅ System patterns and architecture documented with current implementation
- ✅ Technical context and stack identified and aligned with reality
- ✅ Memory bank structure in place and actively maintained
- ✅ **NEW**: Direct UI command refresh_context tracking system
- ✅ **NEW**: Session-based message correlation and scene context synchronization
- ✅ **NEW**: Automatic scene refresh triggers for SceneControls interactions
- ✅ **NEW**: Dual execution path coordination (direct commands + B.L.A.Z.E agent)

## What's Left to Build

- [x] ~~Fix refresh_context tracking for direct UI commands~~ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Document detailed WebSocket message flow patterns and edge cases
- [ ] Optimize scene context update performance for larger scenes
- [ ] Enhance error handling for failed scene refresh attempts
- [ ] Complete template system integration details
- [ ] Document real-time engine coordination and session management
- [ ] Establish comprehensive testing strategies for AI integration
- [ ] Finalize WebRTC streaming and viewport synchronization documentation

## Known Issues

- [x] ~~WebSocket refresh_context bypass issue~~ **FIXED**
- [x] ~~Direct UI commands not triggering scene updates~~ **FIXED**
- [x] ~~Response routing bypassing handler logic~~ **FIXED**
- [ ] WebSocket context manager requires detailed documentation
- [ ] Asset operation validation patterns need clarification
- [ ] Template system operator and property documentation needs completion
- [ ] Real-time engine session management patterns require detailed analysis

## Evolution of Project Decisions

1. **Memory Bank Approach**: Adopted structured documentation system for knowledge persistence
2. **Component Separation**: Maintaining clear boundaries between frontend, Cr8 engine, and Blender integration
3. **AI Integration Focus**: Emphasizing B.L.A.Z.E agent and dynamic capability discovery
4. **Real-time Focus**: Emphasizing WebSocket-based communication and WebRTC streaming
5. **Modular Architecture**: Supporting extensible template and addon systems with standardized manifests
6. **NEW - Session-Based Tracking**: Chose session tracking over handler tracking to prevent response bypass issues
7. **NEW - Automatic Refresh**: Implemented automatic scene context refresh instead of manual refresh buttons

## Recent Technical Achievements

### WebSocket Refresh Context Fix (COMPLETED)

- **Problem**: Direct UI commands with refresh_context flag weren't triggering scene updates
- **Root Cause**: Blender responses bypassed WebSocketHandler and went directly through SessionManager
- **Solution**: Implemented session-based pending_refresh_commands tracking
- **Implementation**:
  - Added Session.pending_refresh_commands dictionary
  - Enhanced SessionManager.forward_message() to check for successful responses
  - Added SessionManager.\_trigger_scene_context_refresh() method
  - Updated WebSocketHandler.\_forward_message() to track refresh_context in session
- **Result**: Direct UI interactions now automatically trigger scene context updates

## Next Documentation Priorities

1. Document the session-based tracking pattern for future WebSocket work
2. Detailed WebSocket message routing and session management documentation
3. Performance optimization patterns for scene context updates
4. Error handling strategies for WebSocket message failures
5. Template system operator and property documentation
6. AI agent context management and dynamic toolset generation

## Verification Points

- [x] Memory bank files align with .clinerules configuration
- [x] System patterns match actual implementation
- [x] Technical context reflects current stack
- [x] Active context priorities are accurate
- [x] **NEW**: Refresh_context tracking system is working correctly
- [x] **NEW**: Session-based message correlation is properly documented
